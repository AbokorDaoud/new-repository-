    <h2>About me </h2>
    <p>I am a multifaceted professional with a rich background in logistics,
         education, and entrepreneurship. I have accumulated over three years of 
         experience as a Logistics Assistant, managing a team of 10 and overseeing critical 
         aspects such as inbound and outbound logistics, warehouse management, and customs procedures. 
         With a Bachelor's degree in Logistics and Transport, specializing in Port Management,
          I have a solid foundation in my field. Additionally, my entrepreneurial spirit is evident from 
          founding a small business selling ice cream and fruit juices in 2021.

        I am a dedicated student at the University of the People, pursuing an associate degree in Computer Science
         while actively learning Python and command-line skills. My passion for education extends to tutoring 
         underprivileged children and engaging in community service through associations focused on family welfare 
         and drug addiction awareness. Fluent in multiple languages, including English, French, Arabic, and Somali, I am currently learning Spanish with a goal to achieve fluency within six months.
        
        My commitment to constant self-improvement is reflected in my pursuit of certifications, 
        such as the Microsoft Office Specialist certification, and participation in professional development 
        programs, including the ALX Back End and Google UX Design Professional Certificate courses. My dedication
         to consistency and eagerness to develop IT skills highlight my dynamic and resourceful nature, making me 
         a driven and capable individual.</p>

<section id="projects">
    <h2>projects</h2>
    <p>I have several exciting future projects that reflect my passion for continuous growth and development. 
        One of my key projects is to further my IT skills by completing the ALX Back End program and subsequently enrolling in the front end program.
         This comprehensive approach to web development will equip me with the skills needed to excel in both back end and front end technologies. 
         Additionally, I am pursuing the Google UX Design Professional Certificate on Coursera to enhance my understanding of user experience design, which will be crucial for creating intuitive and engaging digital products.

        In parallel, I am preparing for the Microsoft Office Specialist certification in Word,
         Excel, and PowerPoint through the Microsoft 365 Fundamentals course. 
         This certification will solidify my proficiency in essential office tools and enhance my productivity
          and efficiency in various professional settings.
        
        Moreover, I plan to expand my entrepreneurial ventures by leveraging my logistics 
        expertise to explore new business opportunities. I aim to innovate within the logistics and supply chain sector, 
        focusing on sustainable practices and technological advancements.
        
        Continuing my commitment to education and community service, I intend to develop a structured program to provide 
        free tutoring and mentorship to underprivileged children. This initiative will aim to bridge the educational gap
         and empower young learners with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed.
        
        Lastly, I am dedicated to achieving fluency in Spanish within the next six months, 
        further expanding my linguistic capabilities and enhancing my ability to connect with 
        diverse communities globally. These projects represent my unwavering commitment to personal 
        and professional development, driving me towards a future filled with innovation, growth, 
        and meaningful impact.</p>
